## Unit Circle Program

This program creates a unit circle quiz consisting of 10 questions.
Each question in the quiz will be in the same range and over the same functions that are listed below which will be selected by the student.
The student sees one question at a time and can not go back to a previous question once the answer has been submitted.
At the end the student sees their score out of 10 and it is sent to some sort of database where the teacher can see the students score.

It has the following ranges:
 * -360° thru 0°
 * 0° thru 360°
 * -2π thru 0
 * 0 thru 2π

It can test any of the following groups of functions
 * `sine` and `cosine`
 * `sine`, `cosine`, and `tangent`
 * `sine`, `cosine`, `tangent`, `secant`, `cosecant`, and `cotangent`
